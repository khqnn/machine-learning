### Day 2:  
**Fairness**
- While building a machine learning model it should be considered the model should be fair
- it should not ignore any group based on race or gender
- there are total 5 categories of unfairness
1. Allocation
2. Quality of service
3. Stereotyping
4. Denigration
5. Over- or under- representation

### Day 1:  
**Introduction to Machine learning**  

- Machine learn data in a similar way as a child learn new things from its surroundings(data and observations)
- Machine learning has many applications like predicting the probability of disease in a patient. detecting spam emails, facial recognition, digital assitants and many more
- There are some computing problems that are very hard to solve by treditional programming techniques. e.g. to distinguish between an image of an orange and and apple. we cannot use just a predicate logic or an algorithm to made that decision. We might need hunderds and thousands of checks. And once we could able to do that then what if also need to distinguish between an apple, orange and mango. So it's just very hard to do that in that way. These kind of problems need different methodolgy than the treditional programming. 
- Machine learning is a subset of the field **Artificial Intellegence**, and the **Deep Learning** is the sub-feild of Machine learning, whereas the term **Data Science** is broader and it has some part of three of them and many other things.
